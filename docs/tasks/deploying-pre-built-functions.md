# Deploying pre-built functions

This guide goes through building functions to container images and then deploying them in a separate process.

## Motivation

If you followed the [function deployment guide](/docs/tasks/deploying-functions.md), you built and deployed a function in a single, convenient step with nuctl. However, it is sometimes desirable to build a function once and deploy it many times with different configuration. This guide will walk you through that process using nuctl.

In this scenario, we'll use the [Go hello-world example](/hack/examples/golang/helloworld).

## Building a function

Using nuctl, we can issue a build - specifying the URL of the Go hello-world:

```sh
nuctl build hello-world --path https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuclio/nuclio/master/hack/examples/golang/helloworld/helloworld.go \
    --registry $(minikube ip):5000
```

This produces the `nuclio/processor-hello-world:latest` image and pushes it to `192.168.64.8:5000`. The image contains everything the function needs to run, except a configuration file. 

## Deploying the pre built function

To deploy the function to our platform, we'll use nuctl deploy specifying `--run-image`. When `--run-image` is present, nuctl does not initiate a build process - only creates a function in the platform and waits for it to become ready.

```sh
nuctl kubdeploy hello-world --run-image localhost:5000/nuclio/processor-hello-world:latest \
    --runtime golang \
    --handler main:Handler \
    --namespace nuclio
```

We can deploy this function several times, providing different labels, triggers, etc - yet still use the same image.
