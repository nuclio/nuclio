# Getting Started with nuclio on Minikube

Follow this step-by-step guide to set up nuclio on Minikube - a Kubernetes cluster on a VM.

## Prepare Minikube

Ensure that the following components are installed on your installation machine:

- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
- [xhyve driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/drivers.md#xhyve-driver)

Start Minikube as you normally would. Note that we are enabling RBAC (disabled by default, as of Minikube 0.24.1) so that we can get more comfortable working with an RBAC enabled Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
minikube start --vm-driver=xhyve --extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC
```

Work around configuration issues in Minikube by giving the kube services cluster admin so that things like kube-dns work in Minikube:

> Note: You are encouraged to peek at the file before applying it, so that you don't get into the habit of blindly running things on your cluster (akin to running scripts off the internet as root).
> If you don't want to elevate your kube services, run Minikube with RBAC disabled (omit `--extra-config` from `minikube start`) and skip applying RBAC related files over the course of installing nuclio

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuclio/nuclio/master/hack/minikube/resources/kubedns-rbac.yaml
```

Bring up a docker registry inside Minikube. You'll later push your functions to this registry:

> Note: You can skip this step if you're a more advanced user and would like to use some other registry like the Docker hub, GCR, ACR, etc. See [Getting started with Kubernetes](/docs/setup/k8s/getting-started-k8s.md) for instructions. 

```sh
minikube ssh -- docker run -d -p 5000:5000 registry:2
```

Before Docker images can be pushed to your built-in registry, you need to add its address (`$(minikube ip):5000`) to the list of insecure registries. If you are using Docker for Mac OS, you can add it under **Preferences > Daemon**.

## Install nuclio

After following your selected Kubernetes installation instructions, you should have a functioning Kubernetes cluster, a Docker registry, and a working local Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`). Let's create the nuclio namespace, where all the services and deployed functions will go. 

```sh
kubectl create namespace nuclio
```

Now you can go ahead and install the nuclio services and RBAC rules on the cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuclio/nuclio/master/hack/k8s/resources/nuclio-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuclio/nuclio/master/hack/k8s/resources/nuclio.yaml
```

Use the command `kubectl get pods --namespace nuclio` to verify that both the controller and playground have a status of `Running`.

## Deploy a function with the nuclio playground

The playground publishes a service at port 8070. We will need to port forward this to our local IP address:

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n nuclio $(kubectl get pods -n nuclio -l nuclio.io/app=playground -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8070:8070
```

And then browse to `http://localhost:8070`. You should be greeted by the [nuclio playground](/README.md#playground). Choose one of the built-in examples, and click **Deploy**. The first build will populate the local Docker cache with base images and other files, so it might take a while depending on your network. When the function deployment is completed, you can click **Invoke** to invoke the function with a body.

## Deploy a function with the nuclio CLI (nuctl)

Start by downloading the latest [nuctl](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/releases) for your platform and then deploy the `helloworld` Go sample function. You can add the `--verbose` flag if you want to peek under the hood:

```sh
nuctl deploy helloworld -n nuclio -p https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuclio/nuclio/master/hack/examples/golang/helloworld/helloworld.go --registry $(minikube ip):5000 --run-registry localhost:5000
```

> Note: The difference between the two registries specified in this command and the reason for their addresses being different is as follows:
>  - The `registry` argument refers to the Docker registry onto which our built function images will be pushed. This is the registry we previously brought up on our minikube VM.
>  - The kubelet will pull the function image from the registry specified by `--run-registry`. Because that happens from within the minikube VM, we specify `localhost` instead of the VMâ€™s IP.

And finally, invoke the function:

```sh
nuctl invoke -n nuclio helloworld
```
