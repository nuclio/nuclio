## Prerequisites

Before starting the set-up procedure, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Your environment has a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) **v1.19 or later** cluster.

- You have the credentials of a Docker registry, such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/), or [Google Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/).

- The [Nuclio CLI](../../reference/nuctl/nuctl.md) (`nuctl`) is installed &mdash; if you wish to [use the CLI to deploy Nuclio functions](#deploy-a-function-with-the-nuclio-cli).
    To install the CLI, simply [download](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/releases) the appropriate CLI version to your installation machine.

## Install Nuclio

At this stage you should have a functioning Kubernetes cluster, credentials to a private Docker registry, and a working Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`), and you can proceed to install the Nuclio services on the cluster (i.e., deploy Nuclio). For more information about `kubectl`, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/).

Follow the instructions of [How to run nuclio in Production](running-in-production-k8s.md)


Use the command `kubectl --namespace nuclio get pods` to verify both the controller and dashboard are running.
