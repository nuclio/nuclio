Code conventions
  - Baseline
    - Follow the latest kubernetes coding conventions: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.1/docs/devel/coding-conventions.md
  - Go
    - Functions should be short and call out to other short functions
    - Choose verbose, descriptive, human readable names (`handler` not `hdlr`, `handleFunctioncrAdd` not `add`). The only exception is with receivers (`func (c *Client) foo()`)
    - Insert newlines before comments and after blocks of code (e.g. a non-nested `}` within a function)
    - Functionality and state must be contained within instantiatable objects. Package level state variables are disallowed
    - Within a struct, exported methods go first, followed by non-exported methods. This holds true to methods conceptually belonging to a struct (e.g. "static" methods without receivers)
  - Testing
    - Use testify and testify suites (see existing examples)
    - Assert with `suite.Require().<assertion>`
    - Function order within a test suite should be:
      - Suite struct declaration
      - SetupSuite (if applicable)
      - SetupTest (if applicable)
      - TearDownTest (if applicable)
      - TearDownSuite (if applicable)
      - Tests
      - Unexported helpers
