# Configuring a Function

There are often cases where providing code is not enough to deploy a function. For example, if:
* The function expects environment variables or secrets
* We'd like to trigger the function through Kafka, Kinesis, etc - who need configuration to connect to the data source
* There are 3rd party dependencies or additional files (both language packages and OS) that need to reside alongside the function

For all these cases and many others, we need to provide a function configuration alongside our function code. nuclio allows us to do that through several mechanisms:
* A `function.yaml` file
* Inline configuration by means of crafting a comment in our code that contains the `function.yaml`
* Command line arguments to `nuctl` (which will override `function.yaml` if both are present)
* The playground UI, through the `configuration` tab

While there are several mechanisms to provide the configuration, there is only one configuration schema.

## Configuration Schema
The basic structure resembles Kubernetes resource definitions, it includes the apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, and status sections. A minimal definition can be seen below:

```yaml
apiVersion: "nuclio.io/v1"
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  image: example:latest
```

## Metadata

The **metadata** section include the following attributes:
* **name**: name of the function
* **namespace**: the kubernetes namespace (can be viewed as an independent project)
* **labels**: a list of key/value tags used for looking up the function, note that "function name", "version", and "alias" are reserved and filled automatically by the controller
* **annotations**: list of key/value based annotations

## Requirement Spec

The **spec** secion contains the requirements and attributes and has the following elements:

* **description** (string): free description of the function
* **handler** (string): the name of the function handler call (nuclio will try to auto detect that)
* **runtime** (string): name of the language runtime (nuclio will try to auto detect that)
* **code**: a structure containing the source code or its location of and access credentials
* **image** (string): full path to the function artifact (container image), note you can either specify the code or the already built image but not both.
* **env**: a name/value environment variable tuple, it is also possible to point to secrets as described in the following example
* **resources**: specify the requested and limit of CPU and Memory resource (similar to Kubernetes pod resources definition)
* **replicas** (int): number of desired instances, 0 for auto-scaling
* **minReplicas** (int): minimum number of replicas
* **maxReplicas** (int): maximum number of replicas
* **disable** (boolean): can be set to True to disable a function
* **dataBindings**: describe a list of data resources used by the function (currently limited to iguazio platform)
* **triggers**: a list of event sources and their configuration, see examples below. trigger name must be unique per function and all its versions (in future it will be possible to move triggers between versions or have the same trigger feed multiple function versions for canary deployments)
* **build**: configuration passed to the builder, specifying things like base image and on-build commands to install dependencies
> Note: Other fields are not fully supported yet, and will be documented when they will be completed.

When creating a function using the CLI **deploy** command each one of the properties above can be specified or overritten using a command line argument, type `nuctl deploy --help` for details.

## Complete Example (YAML)

```yaml
apiVersion: "nuclio.io/v1"
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: myproject
  labels:
    author: joe
spec:
  runtime: golang:1.8
  handler: Handler
  image: example:latest
  replicas: 0
  maxReplicas: 10

  env:
  - name: SOME_ENV
    value: abc
  - name: SECRET_PASSWORD_ENV_VAR
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: my-secret
        key: password

  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "64Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "500m"

  triggers:
    http:
      maxWorkers: 4
      kind: "http"
      attributes:

        # see "Invoking Functions By Name With Kubernetes Ingresses" for more details
        # on configuring ingresses 
        ingresses:
          http:
            host: "host.nuclio"
            paths:
            - "/first/path"
            - "/second/path"
          http2:
            paths:
            - "/wat"

    rmqFunctions:
      kind: "rabbit-mq"
      url: "amqp://user:pass@10.0.0.1:5672"
      attributes:
        exchangeName: "functions"
        queueName: "functions"

    someKafkaTopic:
      kind: "kafka"
      url: "10.0.0.2"
      attributes:
        topic: "my.topic"
        partitions: [0, 5, 10]

    someKinesisStream:
      kind: "kinesis"
      attributes:
        accessKeyID: "my-key"
        secretAccessKey: "my-secret"
        regionName: "eu-west-1"
        streamName: "my-stream"
        shards: [0, 1, 2]

    someNatsTopic:
      kind: "nats"
      url: "10.0.0.3:4222"
      attributes:
        "topic": "my.topic"

  dataBindings:
    db0:
      class: "v3io"
      secret: "something"
      url: "http://192.168.51.240:8081/1024"


```

The example above demonstrates how we can use namespaces, specify labels, use environment variables / secrets and specify exact memory and CPU resources. For the example to work in Kubernetes, the namespace `myproject` and the secret `my-secret` must be defined ahead of time.

> Note: When specifying labels you can list functions based on a specific label selector (using `nuctl get fu -l <selector> `) or see all the labels per function in the wide view (using `nuctl get fu -o wide `)

## Function Templates and Reuse

Users can create a single function YAML file and create multiple functions from it each with different parameters by simply overriding the specific property using a command line flag (e.g. override environment variables).

Instead of building the function code for every function instance we can build it once (using the cli `nuctl build` command), it will generate an artifact in a local or remote image repository, and we can use that artifact in multiple deployments and in different clusters (when using a shared repository).
