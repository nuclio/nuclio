API Gateway
==================================

API Gateway is a service that allows you to expose your functions as a web service.
Essentially, it is a proxy that forwards requests to your functions and returns the response.
It can be used to invoke your functions, and can provide authentication, canary deployments and other features.

See how to create and invoke your functions with the Nuclio API Gateway in different ways:
