# API Gateway via the UI

## In This Section

- [No Authentication](#none-auth)
- [Basic Authentication](#basic-auth)

Creating API Gateways from the UI is really simple.
Inside your project page, go to the **API Gateways** tab, and click **NEW API Gateway**.

There, you can create an API Gateway with the following parameters:

    - *Name*: The name of the API Gateway.
    - *Description*: A description of the API Gateway.
    - *Host*: The host of the API Gateway.
    - *Path*: The path of the API Gateway.
    - *Authentication Mode*: The authentication mode of the API Gateway.
    - *Function*: The function that will be triggered via the API Gateway. 
                  You can also add a canary function and determine the percentage 
                  of traffic that will be sent to the canary function.
