> **Note:** `topics` and `queueName` are mutually exclusive.
> The trigger can either create to an existing queue specified by `queueName` or create its own queue, subscribing it to `topics` 

> **Note:** when running in Kubernetes / docker, the consumer name is the host name (pod name, e.g.: `my-pod-1234`)
> and the connection name is consisted of `nuclio-<func-name>-<trigger-name>` to allow differentiation between multiple functions
> consuming from the same server.
