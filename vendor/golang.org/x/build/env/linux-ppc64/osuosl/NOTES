The linux-ppc64 buildlets run on PPC64 VMs at osuosl.org (OSU Open Source Lab).

They run Debian jessie.

Filing tickets: https://support.osuosl.org/
    Ticket username: bradfitz@golang.org
    Ticket password: http://go/pw-osuosl-ppc64

Machines:

go-be-1: debian@140.211.168.40
go-be-2: debian@140.211.168.41
go-be-3: debian@140.211.168.42
go-be-4: debian@140.211.168.43
go-be-5: debian@140.211.168.44

They accept ssh key 'id_ed25519_golang1'. For example,

     ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_golang1 debian@140.211.168.40
     (key from http://go/go-builders-ssh)

Each was once configured by scping setup.bash to them, logging in to
each, and running:

$ sudo ./setup.bash <BUILDKEY_HERE>

TODO: these should be updated like linux-arm and linux-arm64 to use Docker
      per build. That is https://golang.org/issue/21189
