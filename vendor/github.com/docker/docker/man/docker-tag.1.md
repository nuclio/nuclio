# NAME
docker-tag - Create a tag `TARGET_IMAGE` that refers to `SOURCE_IMAGE`

# SYNOPSIS
**docker tag**
[**--help**]
SOURCE_NAME[:TAG] TARGET_NAME[:TAG]

# DESCRIPTION
Assigns a new alias to an image in a registry. An alias refers to the
entire image name including the optional `TAG` after the ':'. 

# "OPTIONS"
**--help**
   Print usage statement.

**NAME**
   The image name which is made up of slash-separated name components, 
   optionally prefixed by a registry hostname. The hostname must comply with 
   standard DNS rules, but may not contain underscores. If a hostname is 
   present, it may optionally be followed by a port number in the format 
   `:8080`. If not present, the command uses Docker's public registry located at
   `registry-1.docker.io` by default. Name components may contain lowercase 
   characters, digits and separators. A separator is defined as a period, one or 
   two underscores, or one or more dashes. A name component may not start or end 
   with a separator.

**TAG**
   The tag assigned to the image to version and distinguish images with the same
   name. The tag name may contain lowercase and uppercase characters, digits, 
   underscores, periods and dashes. A tag name may not start with a period or a 
   dash and may contain a maximum of 128 characters.

# EXAMPLES

## Tagging an image referenced by ID

To tag a local image with ID "0e5574283393" into the "fedora" repository with 
"version1.0":

    docker tag 0e5574283393 fedora/httpd:version1.0

## Tagging an image referenced by Name

To tag a local image with name "httpd" into the "fedora" repository with 
"version1.0":

    docker tag httpd fedora/httpd:version1.0

Note that since the tag name is not specified, the alias is created for an
existing local version `httpd:latest`.

## Tagging an image referenced by Name and Tag

To tag a local image with name "httpd" and tag "test" into the "fedora"
repository with "version1.0.test":

    docker tag httpd:test fedora/httpd:version1.0.test

## Tagging an image for a private repository

To push an image to a private registry and not the central Docker
registry you must tag it with the registry hostname and port (if needed).

    docker tag 0e5574283393 myregistryhost:5000/fedora/httpd:version1.0
