registry:

  # By default, the chart does not advocate using helm to manage registry credentials. You should create a secret
  # manually as follows and specify secret name here:
  #
  # kubectl create secret docker-registry <name> --namespace <namespace> \
  #     --docker-username <username> \
  #     --docker-password <password> \
  #     --docker-server <url> \
  #     --docker-email ignored@nuclio.io
  #
  # If you'd still like to have this managed as part of the helm chart, comment out this line and populate
  # the credentials stanza below. The chart will create a secret for you (note: the credentials will be
  # visible to anyone with access to helm) and name it after the release
  #
  secretName: registry-credentials

  # In some cases the docker server URL in the registry secrets isn't the same as the URL with which
  # you push and pull. For example, in GKE you login to `gcr.io` (or some other regional URL) yet have
  # to push/pull from `gcr.io/<project-name>. If this is the case, specify the url here and it will be
  # used instead of the url in the secrets
  #
  # pushPullUrl: gcr.io/<project-name>

  # In case you'd like helm to generate the secret for you by uncommenting secretName, `loginUrl` specifies
  # the URL with which the components in nuclio will try to login to
  #
  # loginUrl: someurl

  # See the note for `secretName`
  # credentials:
    # username: someuser
    # password: somepass

rbac:

  # If true, creates the necessary roles and role bindings for nuclio's service account
  create: true
