  description: >
    A multi-trigger function with a configuration that connects to RabbitMQ to read messages and write them to local
    ephemeral storage. If triggered with an HTTP GET request, the function returns the messages that
    it read from RabbitMQ.

  # Note that we're not specifying handler. This is because the Golang runtime
  # can find handlers automatically.
  runtime: "golang"

  # you'll need to specify the user, password and address of a working rabbit mq
  # to actually see this working
